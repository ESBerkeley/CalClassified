Prerequisites:

pip install virtualenv wrapper
virtualenv env
source ./env/bin/activate

deactivate 
=> when done

--------------------------------------------
-django 1.4.3 or greater

NOTE: as of jun 5, there is no need to use easy_install to get django_evolution, django_registration, or django_facebook.
However, you will have to download, compile and install the python imaging library to use django-facebook.
(You may not yet encounter this error as you still have the old version of django_facebook installed on your machine,
which is overriding the new one in this repo. So, it would be best to delete the old one, and grab PIL to satisfy the new one.)
