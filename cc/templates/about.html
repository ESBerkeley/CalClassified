                    A platform for communities to share items and exchange goods.<br><br>

We've created a social marketplace, which feeds off Facebook wall posts and the egregious methods of trading currently available for small communities. This way you can buy and sell items not only to all of your facebook friends, but also to circles and communities you've chosen, such as a college or a large student organization (e.g.
Tau Beta Pi). That way, items listed are more relevant and closer in proximity to the community they represent. Many items, such as student football tickets or textbooks, cannot be sold effectively using conventional methods because the items are not tailored for the market. You can also utilize our platform to share items within a circle without needing your friends to create an account, replacing the archaic excel spreadsheet.
<br><br>
We are also replacing the old listing with a throwback to the newspaper. Listings are automatically generated for the user based on their favorite searches, categories, and circles selected, with your friends' items representing "larger" more prominent front page articles. Using this method, items are automatically generated on the fly for the user in a clean and fun way.
