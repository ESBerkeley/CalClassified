                    BuyNearMe began on April 2012 with a group of friends from UC Berkeley with the simple idea that campus trading should be a lot easier,
                    although we learned that it would not be simple to translate this idea into a product.
                    Finally on January 2013, after months of energy drinks (majority consumed by Rory), Stack Overflow threads, and a bunch of random keyboard clicks later BuyNearMe was born!
                    <br><br>
                    BuyNearMe is a student-run social marketplace focused on providing an intuitive way for you to sell to your friends
                    and people who share your interests. Use it to sell that furniture that's gathering dust in the corner,
                    or to pick up cheap textbooks without going to the store.
                    <br><br>
                    We're making it easy to get rid of your stuff in a safe and friendly way to reach the people closest to you, literally and figuratively.

                    <!--
                    To sell, simply log in via Facebook (or create a non-Facebook account) and upload a picture and description of that old desk lamp.
                    Set a price, and share the post with people you know.
                    Then, interested buyers will shoot you a message to your registered e-mail inbox as well as your website account to arrange a meet to take it off your hands.
                    <br><br>
                    Conversely, if you're looking to buy something, just create an account,
                    and filter and search for what you want. When you find something, just click the "buy/contact" button to arrange the pickup.
