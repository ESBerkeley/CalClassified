                    BuyNearMe began on April 2012 with a group of friends from UC Berkeley with the simple idea that campus
                    trading should be a lot easier,
                    although we learned that it would not be simple to translate this idea into a product.
                    Finally on January 2013, after months of energy drinks (majority consumed by Rory),
                    Stack Overflow threads, and a bunch of random keyboard clicks later BuyNearMe was born!
